I tried out some things relating to authentication in Blazor. Using this, I show the current user and their pcÂ´s name; additionally, certain elements are hidden when the user doesnt have the correct policies.
This is useful to show users only the contents that they should see, based on company policy (e.g. AD). Because permissions are referenced from a central entity, any changes made to that entity will result in changes in all web-apps written in this way.
