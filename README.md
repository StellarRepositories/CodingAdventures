# CodingAdventures
Welcome to my GitHub! 
In this repo, I post some of the things I've done on my journey to mastering all things code. 
Every subfolder is one projekt. Inside you will find all the files that are nescessary for the project. 
I use Visual Studio 2022 with .Net 6 or .NET 8. Newer projects will always be in .NET 8. 

Projects range from basic console applications to solve small problems, e.g. leetcode, to Blazor applications for learning the ins and outs of the Blazor framework. 

Everything you find in here is written by me, without the use of AIs like Github Copilot or ChatGPT. 
Even though those are great tools for productivity, they shortcut the important part where learning happens (in my opinion) so i avoid them when approaching new concepts.
