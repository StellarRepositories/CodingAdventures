# CodingAdventures
Welcome to my GitHub! 
In this repo, I post some of the things I've done on my journey to mastering all things code. 
Every subfolder is one projekt. Inside you will find all the files that are nescessary for the project. 
I use Visual Studio 2022 with .Net 6 or .NET 8. Newer projects will always be in .NET 8. 

Everything you find in here is written by me, without the use of AIs like Github Copilot or ChatGPT.
